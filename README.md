The idea for Ticketing Tool was born in 2022, when I was 13 years old, initially under the name "Ticketize". I wanted to create a completely free and open-source Discord bot with advanced and customizable features, accessible to everyone. I wanted it to become the most widely used ticketing bot across all of Discord. Within a few months, the bot achieved official Discord verification (you can find it on the official Discord App directory), but since I was underage, I had a friend of legal age verify it for me (due to Discord’s Terms of Service). The development of the bot was later discontinued due to my age—after a while, maintaining such a project would have required money, which, given my age, I didn’t have. The code was later lost because I deleted the repository.

At the beginning of 2025, I decided to try creating the bot again, but this time with a different goal: to rewrite the bot's code using my own library for interacting with the Discord API: disgroove, and without officially publishing it on Discord in order to avoid maintenance costs.

This is NOT the official code of the original bot since I lost the old code, it does NOT contain the same features, and it does NOT have the same messages. (I forgot everything.)
